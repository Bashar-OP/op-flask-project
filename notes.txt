Step 1: Project Setup
Create a new file named app.py in this folder.
Initialize a Flask app and set a SECRET_KEY.
Add a single route / that supports GET and POST.
---

Step 2: Build the HTML Form
Create a form with these fields:

    Name (text)

Email (email)Password (password)Confirm Password (password)Bio (textarea, minimum 20 chars)Agree to Terms (checkbox)
Requirements:

    Use the correct name for each input.

Use method="post" in the form.
Add required on all fields except the bio.
---

Step 3: Read Form Data
In your route:

    On POST, read submitted values using request.form.get().

Strip whitespace for text fields.Store values in a dictionary called form_data.
---

Step 4: Validate Inputs
Create a validate(form_data) function that returns a list of errors:

Validation rules:

    Name is required.

Email must include @.Password is at least 8 characters.Confirm password must match password.Bio must be at least 20 characters if provided.Agree to Terms must be checked.
---

Step 5: Show Errors Inline
If validation fails:

    Re-render the form.

Display errors near the form.
Refill the inputs with the user’s previous values (except password).
---

Step 6: Flash + Redirect
If validation passes:

    flash() a success message.

Redirect back to / (Post/Redirect/Get).Show the flashed message at the top of the form.

Step 7: Final Checklist
Form uses POST and route accepts POST.
Inputs have name attributes.Server-side validation is implemented.Errors are displayed to the user.Successful POST redirects and flashes a message.
